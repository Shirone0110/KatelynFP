    <h1> Final Project Topic: Animal Abuse</h1>
        <p> This topic has always been very important to me because I love animals and they will always have a place in my heart. I chose this topic because of the connection I have with animals and the amount of data I could compile with this broad topic. For my final topic I will discuss animal abuse as a whole, what states are the worst for animals, and the connections animal abuse has to other crimes.   </p>
